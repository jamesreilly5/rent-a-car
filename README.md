# rent-a-car
React app that displays a JSON feed of rental cars

## Problem - Assessment for front end developer:

In order to verify your skillset for the role there is a small task that must be accomplished. The URL supplied below contains a JSON response that represents car availability. Using any JavaScript framework of your choice ( our favourite is AngularJS ), create a static HTML document that displays a visual representation of the following feed.

URL feed: http://www.cartrawler.com/ctabe/cars.json

Core objectives:

- Parse message from URL feed
- Create a visual representation of the list of cars using HTML5 and CSS3 techniques.
- Each car block must contain all attribute data supplied in feed e.g. Vendor, Passenger,
- Default order of cars must be driven by ‘Price’.
- Extract the Pickup/Return information and display as ‘Legend’ above car list.
- Show us the quality of your code, and project structure

Advanced (optional):
- Surprise us!
- Maybe: a group by ‘Vendor’ option?
- Maybe: order the car list via alternate custom sorting techniques?

Deliverable:
- Email in zipped up version of all code and libraries used

Note:
All core objectives must be met in order to validate your skillset (Quantity, Fuel Type etc…)
